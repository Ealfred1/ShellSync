setup
SSH-based Connection (more secure):
We can add SSH-based remote control by modifying our agent to connect to remote systems. Would you like me to implement this?
VPN-based Connection:
Set up a VPN server on the target system
Connect your client device to the VPN
Access the control interface through the VPN
Which approach would you prefer? The current setup already works for controlling a system on your local network, but we can add SSH support if you want to control remote systems securely over the internet.
To install the dependencies and run the system:
Apply
Run
Then you can access it from any device on your network at http://<your-ip>:8000/api/system-info/
Would you like me to:
Add SSH-based remote control functionality?
Add authentication to make it more secure?
Or would you prefer to test the current local network setup first?
